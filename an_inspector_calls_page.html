                         <h3>Theme 1- <b>Social Message</b></h3>
                             <p>
                          The first theme that is greatly used in the novel is the social message that Priestly is trying to convey this being the drastic difference between social classes and how they are treated.
                          This can be seen by how Mr and Mrs Birling talk, this is how Priestly wanted to show the clear divide between people and classes

                            <p>
                           The theme of responsibility is important in the novel as it is the main purpose for the troubles that the characters feel, this theme is also what splits the family in two
                           showing the difference in the time. This theme also supports the theme of social status as the older generation refuses to change and hold resposibility for the actions while the younger generation
                           thats is less bound by social status are willing to change and see there mistakes.

                        <h3>Theme 3- <b>Morality</b></h3>
                             <p>
                              As well as responsibility the theme of morality plays are large part in the novels and its what makes the characters act this can be seen with the different characters, Mr and Mrs Birling
                              seem to have a lack of morality and do not regret the actions that they have taken while Shiela and Eric want to change this moral compass also helps to expand the other two themes as they all link together.
